My Penrose Config
=================

penrose: [![Build](https://github.com/sminez/penrose/workflows/Build/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/sminez/penrose/actions?query=workflow%3ABuild) [![crates.io version](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/penrose)](https://crates.io/crates/penrose)

This is my personal set up for the penrose tiling WM library that I write.
It relies on a number of custom scripts and external programs (in the repo), in
addition to being heavily customised for my day to day workflow. You probably
don't want to use _everything_ that is here but you may find some things of
interest that you want for your own config.


### Supporting files
I have included some of the `scripts` and `.config` directories that I use in my
personal set up which is what you will see in the
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC04N-5DxEWH4ioK0bvZmF_Q) videos
showcasing penrose.
My patched forks of the suckless tools can be found [here](https://github.com/sminez/suckless).


### Wallpaper
The wallpaper that I use is, fittingly, a penrose tiling. It was generated using
a wonderful [online tool](https://misc.0o0o.org/penrose/) that I found which you
can use to generate your own wallpapers should you wish. You'll need to use a
tool such as `imagemagick` to convert the SVG generated by the site into
something like a PNG so that you can use it as a wallpaper.
